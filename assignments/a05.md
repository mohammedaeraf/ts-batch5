# 📘 **Assignment 05 – Tuples, Interfaces & Intersections**

## 🎯 **Objective:**

Reinforce your understanding of key TypeScript features:

* Representing structured data using **tuples**
* Creating reusable contracts using **interfaces**
* Merging object types using **intersection types**

---

## 📝 **Tasks:**

---

### 🔷 Q1. **Create a Tuple**

Define a tuple called `location` to store latitude and longitude as numbers:

```ts
let location: [number, number];
```

Assign values to the tuple and print:

```
Latitude: <value>, Longitude: <value>
```

---

### 🔷 Q2. **Create an Interface `Book`**

The `Book` interface should contain:

* `title: string`
* `author: string`
* `publishedYear: number`
* `summary?: string` (optional)

Create two `Book` objects:

* One with a summary
* One without a summary

---

### 🔷 Q3. **Function with Interface Parameter**

Write a function `printBookDetails(book: Book)` that:

* Prints title, author, and year
* Prints summary only if available

---

### 🔷 Q4. **Intersection Types**

Create two types:

* `Customer` with `name` (string) and `email` (string)
* `BillingDetails` with `cardNumber` (string) and `expiryDate` (string)

Create a new type `BillingCustomer` using intersection (`&`)
Create an object of this type and print its properties.

## ✨ **Sample Output:**

```
Latitude: 12.97, Longitude: 77.59
Book: The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho
Published: 1988
Summary: A spiritual journey of self-discovery

Customer Name: Aisha
Email: aisha@example.com
Card Number: **** **** **** 1234
Expiry: 12/26
```

## 📚 **What You'll Practice**

| Topic          | Concept Strengthened                     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `tuple`        | Typed, fixed-size arrays                 |
| `interface`    | Object structure and optional properties |
| `intersection` | Combining multiple types                 |
