## 📝 **Tasks:**

---

### 🔹 Q1: Define an object type for `Book`

Create a `type` alias called `Book` with the following fields:

* `title: string`
* `author: string`
* `publishedYear: number`
* `summary?: string` (optional)

Then, create **two book objects**:

* One with summary
* One without summary

---

### 🔹 Q2: Create a function `printBookDetails(book: Book)`

It should:

* Print all book details
* Print the summary only if it's provided

---

### 🔹 Q3: Use Union Types for `productId`

Declare a variable `productId` that can accept a `string` or a `number`.
Assign both values and print them using a function `displayProductId(id: number | string)`.
